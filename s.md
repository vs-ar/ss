To help you with the implementation, I'll provide a detailed breakdown of the code for each part of the project. Given that you're using **LangChain** and **Hugging Face**'s generative models, we'll follow the approach outlined in your assignment.

Iâ€™ll assume you have the following libraries installed:
- `transformers` (for Hugging Face models)
- `langchain` (for the agentic system)
- `requests` (for UMLS API calls)
- `sentence-transformers` (for semantic similarity checks)
- `json` (for working with JSON format)
- `spacy` (for tokenization)

First, let's break the implementation into parts:

---

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

1. **Load the CADEC dataset**: This is just an example of how you might load the data if it is in a CSV or text format.

2. **Abbreviation Expansion**: This can be done with a Hugging Face model, like GPT-3 or BART, which can expand abbreviations.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load Hugging Face pipeline for text generation (abbreviation expansion)
abbreviation_expansion = pipeline('text2text-generation', model='facebook/bart-large-cnn')

def expand_abbreviations(text):
    # Generate expanded form for any abbreviations in the text
    return abbreviation_expansion(text)[0]['generated_text']

# Sample text with abbreviations
sample_text = "I had severe headaches after taking NSAIDs."

expanded_text = expand_abbreviations(sample_text)
print(expanded_text)
```

---

### Step 2: Medical Entity Extraction

For extracting medical entities like drugs, ADEs, and symptoms, you can use a Hugging Face model fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER) or text generation. Alternatively, you could fine-tune your own model on the CADEC dataset.

Here is an example using Hugging Face's `pipeline` for NER.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load Hugging Face NER pipeline (use a model fine-tuned for medical entities if available)
ner_pipeline = pipeline('ner', model='dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english')

def extract_medical_entities(text):
    # Use NER pipeline to extract entities
    entities = ner_pipeline(text)
    return entities

# Example text to extract medical entities
sample_text = "I took Aspirin and experienced severe nausea."

entities = extract_medical_entities(sample_text)
print(entities)
```

This will extract medical entities (e.g., drugs, symptoms) from text. You can filter them into drugs, ADEs, and symptoms based on the labels in your model.

### Step 3: Entity Standardization with UMLS

To standardize the entities (e.g., drugs to RxNorm, symptoms to SNOMED CT), you will need to call the UMLS API. Below is an example of how you could query the UMLS API to standardize a drug name.

You must first obtain a UMLS API key and set up the UMLS API connection.

```python
import requests

UMLS_API_KEY = "YOUR_UMLS_API_KEY"
UMLS_API_URL = "https://uts-ws.nlm.nih.gov/rest"

def get_umls_concept(entity_name):
    # Query UMLS for a concept by name (this assumes you already have a UMLS API key)
    url = f"{UMLS_API_URL}/content/2023AA/CUI/{entity_name}/semanticTypes"
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {UMLS_API_KEY}'}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

# Example drug
drug_name = "Aspirin"
concept_data = get_umls_concept(drug_name)
print(concept_data)
```

---

### Step 4: Verification System

You need to implement verification checks. The checks you want to perform are:

1. **Format Verification**: Ensure your output is a valid JSON schema.
2. **Completeness Check**: Compare your extractions to the CADEC ground truth.
3. **Semantic Similarity Check**: Use **Sentence Transformers** to compare extracted entities with the ground truth.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np

# Load a sentence transformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def semantic_similarity_check(entity, ground_truth):
    # Get sentence embeddings for both entity and ground truth
    embeddings = model.encode([entity, ground_truth])
    
    # Compute cosine similarity
    cosine_sim = np.dot(embeddings[0], embeddings[1]) / (np.linalg.norm(embeddings[0]) * np.linalg.norm(embeddings[1]))
    return cosine_sim

# Example usage
entity = "Aspirin"
ground_truth = "Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic acid)"
similarity = semantic_similarity_check(entity, ground_truth)
print(f"Cosine Similarity: {similarity}")
```

---

### Step 5: Agentic Iterative Correction

To implement the agentic correction, you can retry extraction using a generative model and log failures:

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool, AgentType

# Initialize generative model (e.g., GPT-3 or BART) for retries
retry_agent = initialize_agent([
    Tool(name="Generative Model", func=expand_abbreviations, description="Expands abbreviations")
], agent_type=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION)

def retry_extraction_with_feedback(text, retries=3):
    for i in range(retries):
        result = retry_agent.run(text)
        # Check if result is valid (you could validate using your semantic checks)
        if result_is_valid(result):  # You can define this based on your criteria
            return result
        else:
            print(f"Retry {i + 1} failed, retrying...")
    return None

def result_is_valid(result):
    # Implement your own validation logic (e.g., check if entities are correct)
    return True

# Example of retrying extraction with feedback
sample_text = "My skin was itchy after using Ibuprofen."
corrected_text = retry_extraction_with_feedback(sample_text)
print(corrected_text)
```

### Conclusion

The steps above outline the code for each part of the assignment:

1. **Preprocessing**: Handle abbreviation expansion.
2. **Entity Extraction**: Extract drugs, ADEs, and symptoms using Hugging Face NER models.
3. **Standardization**: Standardize using the UMLS API.
4. **Verification**: Perform checks for format, completeness, and semantic similarity.
5. **Agentic Correction**: Retry extraction with feedback.
