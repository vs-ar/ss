Below is an outline for how you might implement an agentic NLP system for adverse drug event extraction based on the CADEC dataset, using LangChain, langgraph, and Hugging Face’s generative models. This design is intended to meet the requirements in the assignment:

---

### 1. Overview

Your goal is to develop a system that processes patient forum posts from the CADEC dataset, extracts key medical entities (drugs, adverse drug events, symptoms/diseases), and then standardizes these entities via UMLS APIs. The system is built as an agent that iteratively refines its output using a verification system. In other words, if the initial extraction does not meet quality checks, the system provides feedback and retries (up to 3 times), logging its progress at each step.

### 2. System Architecture

#### A. Data Preprocessing
- **Loading Data:** Import the CADEC forum posts and extract the relevant text sections.
- **Abbreviation Expansion:** Use a generative model from Hugging Face to expand any abbreviations found in the text.
- **Tokenization & Normalization:** Tokenize the input text and normalize drug names (for instance, converting brand names to generic names where applicable).

#### B. Medical Entity Extraction
- **Generative Model:** Utilize a Hugging Face generative model to extract entities. The model should output a structured JSON containing:
  - **Drugs (medications)**
  - **Adverse Drug Events (ADEs)**
  - **Symptoms/Diseases**
- **Structured Output:** Ensure that the extracted information follows a clear JSON schema for downstream processing.

#### C. Entity Standardization with UMLS
- **Mapping to UMLS:** 
  - For **Drugs**, use RxNorm mappings.
  - For **ADEs and Symptoms**, map to SNOMED CT concepts.
- **API Integration:** Query the UMLS API to retrieve the best matching concept (e.g., the Concept Unique Identifier, or CUI) and replace the raw extracted entity with the standardized term.

#### D. Verification System
Implement three verification checks:
1. **Format Verification:** Check that the JSON output conforms to the predefined schema.
2. **Completeness Check:** Compare the extracted entities against CADEC ground truth annotations (if available).
3. **Semantic Similarity Check:** Use cosine similarity (via Sentence Transformers) to ensure the extracted entities semantically align with expected medical terms.

#### E. Agentic Iterative Correction
- **Feedback Loop:** If any of the verification checks fail, the system should automatically provide feedback to the generative model and re-run the extraction.
- **Retry Limit:** Limit the retry mechanism to a maximum of 3 attempts.
- **Logging:** Keep detailed logs at each iteration to capture failures, corrections, and improvements.

#### F. Integration with LangChain & langgraph
- **LangChain:** Use it to build the agent that manages the sequential steps (data ingestion, extraction, verification, and iteration).
- **langgraph:** Integrate langgraph to design and visualize the data flow and agent decision-making process.

### 3. Implementation Details & Sample Pseudocode

Below is a simplified pseudocode outline that integrates these components:

```python
import json
import logging
from transformers import pipeline
from langchain.agents import Agent
from umls_api import query_umls  # Hypothetical UMLS API wrapper
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Load models
extraction_model = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="your-hf-model-name")
similarity_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

def preprocess_data(text):
    # Expand abbreviations and normalize text
    expanded_text = extraction_model(f"Expand abbreviations: {text}")[0]['generated_text']
    # Additional tokenization and normalization can be added here
    return expanded_text

def extract_entities(text):
    # Extract medical entities using the generative model
    extraction_prompt = f"Extract drugs, adverse drug events, and symptoms in JSON: {text}"
    result = extraction_model(extraction_prompt)[0]['generated_text']
    try:
        entities = json.loads(result)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        entities = None
    return entities

def standardize_entities(entities):
    standardized = {}
    for key in ["drugs", "ades", "symptoms"]:
        standardized[key] = []
        for item in entities.get(key, []):
            if key == "drugs":
                std_item = query_umls(item, target="RxNorm")
            else:
                std_item = query_umls(item, target="SNOMED_CT")
            standardized[key].append(std_item)
    return standardized

def verify_output(entities, ground_truth=None):
    # Format verification: Check if output is valid JSON and matches schema
    if not isinstance(entities, dict) or not all(k in entities for k in ["drugs", "ades", "symptoms"]):
        return False

    # Completeness check: If ground_truth is available, compare keys
    if ground_truth:
        if not all(entity in entities.get("drugs", []) for entity in ground_truth.get("drugs", [])):
            return False

    # Semantic similarity check: Example for one pair
    for entity in entities.get("ades", []):
        # Hypothetically compare with known medical term embeddings
        known_embedding = similarity_model.encode("known adverse event")
        entity_embedding = similarity_model.encode(entity)
        similarity = util.cos_sim(known_embedding, entity_embedding)
        if similarity < 0.5:  # Threshold can be tuned
            return False

    return True

def agentic_extraction(text, max_retries=3):
    attempt = 0
    while attempt < max_retries:
        processed_text = preprocess_data(text)
        extracted_entities = extract_entities(processed_text)
        if not extracted_entities:
            logging.error("Extraction failed, retrying...")
            attempt += 1
            continue

        # Optionally standardize extracted entities
        standardized_entities = standardize_entities(extracted_entities)

        # Verification step
        if verify_output(standardized_entities):
            logging.info("Verification passed.")
            return standardized_entities
        else:
            logging.warning(f"Verification failed on attempt {attempt+1}. Retrying extraction with feedback...")
            # Modify the prompt or add feedback based on logs
            attempt += 1

    logging.error("Max retries reached. Logging failure details.")
    return None

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Suppose 'text' is loaded from a CADEC forum post.
    text = "Patient post text here with abbreviations like SOB for shortness of breath."
    final_entities = agentic_extraction(text)
    if final_entities:
        print("Final extracted and standardized entities:")
        print(json.dumps(final_entities, indent=2))
    else:
        print("Extraction failed after maximum retries.")
```

### 4. Key Considerations

- **Entity Extraction Accuracy:** Fine-tune your generative model and use prompt engineering to improve entity recognition accuracy.
- **UMLS Standardization:** Ensure robust error handling when querying the UMLS API so that mapping failures can be gracefully managed.
- **Verification Checks:** Implement thorough testing to define and adjust thresholds for semantic similarity, ensuring that verification minimizes false negatives/positives.
- **Agentic Behavior:** The system should log every attempt and the associated feedback to facilitate iterative learning and potential manual review.
- **Documentation:** Write modular code with clear documentation so that each component (preprocessing, extraction, standardization, verification) is well understood and maintainable.

This design should give you a solid framework to build an agentic NLP system that not only extracts adverse drug events but also iteratively improves its performance to meet a life-saving mission. Feel free to expand on each module, add error handling, and refine prompts to suit your specific research context.
