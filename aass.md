Below is an updated, comprehensive implementation that incorporates additional logic and refinements to maximize accuracy and safety. In this version, we’ve enhanced the verification step by cleaning mapping prefixes before computing semantic similarity and added an iterative correction loop that feeds back error hints into the extraction prompt. In a production setting you would replace the simulated UMLS mappings and model prompts with real API calls and fine‐tuned models, but the structure here reflects a domain-aware, safety-critical design.

### Explanation of Key Enhancements

1. **Preprocessing & Abbreviation Expansion:**  
   The system first expands abbreviations using a generative model and then tokenizes and normalizes the text to ensure consistent input for downstream tasks.

2. **Entity Extraction with Feedback:**  
   The `extract_entities` function now accepts an optional `feedback` parameter. If prior iterations fail verification, feedback is added to the extraction prompt to request more detailed or accurate output.

3. **UMLS Standardization:**  
   The extracted entities are mapped to standardized terms (simulated as prefixed strings). In a production system, these functions would call the UMLS API to fetch RxNorm and SNOMED CT identifiers.

4. **Enhanced Verification:**  
   The verification function now removes mapping prefixes before computing semantic similarity. This helps ensure that the core entity terms are being compared to the original text. The function also checks JSON structure and that at least one entity was extracted.

5. **Iterative Agentic Correction:**  
   The `run_agent_with_iterations` function re-runs the pipeline with accumulated feedback if verification fails. This iterative loop is capped at three attempts, ensuring both safety and accountability.

6. **Graph-Based Pipeline:**  
   The pipeline is also set up as a langgraph agent, clearly mapping out each processing step and its data dependencies, which aids in debugging and modular improvements.

This refined implementation is designed with life-critical accuracy in mind. Each stage includes robust logging and error handling so that, in a real-world deployment, issues can be traced and addressed rapidly to ensure that adverse drug event extraction meets the highest standards of reliability and safety.
